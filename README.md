This fork attempts to de-localize the original whose parts are sourced from local areas in Spain, which can make finding certain parts hard. Also updated part names that were perhaps lost in translation.

The links in the parts list is not perfect but it should give you an idea of what to look for. Ebay/Amazon are easy to source from and usually cheap, I personally don't like Alibaba (the UI and search results layout) but it should work too.

Currently working on documentation and updating firmware/software suite and a set protocol

Current proposal uses a version of Firmata based on the 2.4 release and the additional features of RobustFirmata. This requires a host running client software that adheres to those protocols though future revisions might allow for the ability to switch between Firmata and Knitic control. The reason for the change is because as of now the Knitic firmware is still under development and Firmata clients come in various languages that could aid in development from desktop applications to web apps giving developers more freedom in language.

OpenKnit is a project that offers a new digital fabrication tool, an open-source knitting machine that can create ready-to-wear clothes from digital files. 

The documentation for the Wally340 is outdated, currently working on the development of the Wally120 since it's cheaper, smaller, easier to assemble and it works better. Although, the improvements of the Wally120 can be scaled up if you want to create bigger garments.

WARNING: this project is at an early stage of development, every piece of hardware and software is in beta version, testing and testing, if you are an adventurer this is a place for you.
