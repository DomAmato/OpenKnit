Microswitches,2,2,http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&page=1&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Amicroswitch,bought wherever pick your flavor
Acrylic,810x635x3mm,,http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&page=1&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Amicroswitch  ,"It needs to be laser cut but not especially large pieces. They are roughly 15""x4"" for each component. Says 3mm thick but perhaps could be 1/8th inch instead. I don’t know that there is an equivently thickness in material since it is slightly smaller than an 1/8th but larger than 1/16"

Step accuracy isn't actually a huge deal since it takes multiple steps to get between needles and microstepping actually slows things down
Arduino Board,1,1,,"Pick your favorite, really doesn't matter unless you want to use a sheild but its really not needed"

"eBay was generally the cheapest place for a lot of these items but quote out the price of the aluminum extrusions since they are by far the most expensive part of the whole contraption. I did not include the price of 3d printing things since that really depends on the filament etc. Also for some reason the big unit had hall effect sensors and a photoresistor in the parts list but I dont see why they were added on the actual machine or why since no magnets are included in the parts list. I did not include an encoder as the keeping track of the steppers steps should be fine. As a heads up everything is metric so you will need nuts and bolts and so on that are metric sizes so thats an included cost too. Mostly M3 sizes it looks like. I also didn't inlude the cost of an arduino or shield, I think it can easily be deisgned with a teensy 2.0. I recommend the 2.0 since the newer 3.0s run on ARM and thus 3.3v instead of 5.",,,,
